PuppyJusticeAutomated
=====================

This is the program that is used to generate videos for the PuppyJusticeAutomated
youtube channel. Most of the video manipulation work is done using the excelent
[moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy) project.

This codebase initially started as a kind of joke and I never really refactored it,
so 'here there be dragons' applies.
